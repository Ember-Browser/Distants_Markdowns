# My thoughts on Microsoft Windows

Microsoft Windows is a well-known platform, hell, 96% of people on Steam use it.
But if so many people use it, what's so wrong with it?
Clearly if it has so many users, there must be a reason...
That's exactly what I want to talk about.
But in order to fully grasp it, we may need go through a brief history of Windows...

## A brief history of Windows, and how far Microsoft pushed to achieve market dominance
What I'm about to say is going to sound shocking, especially if you know me.

**Microsoft Windows wasn't always a bad platform.**

Allow me to elaborate.

Microsoft Windows started out as being basically a GUI for a utility/OS known as MS-DOS, or the Microsoft Disk Operating System. MS-DOS, or simply DOS, was incredibly widespread due to being one of the first computer operating systems without exclusivity. That is, MS-DOS could be licensed to other manufacturers and built into a non-Microsoft machine. On top of that, it provided a hardware abstraction layer, an API of sorts, that developers could use to make their software hardware-agnostic (Not requiring any specific make or model of CPU, or anything similar). While there were other options at the time, MS-DOS was the simplest to use, so a GUI for MS-DOS would serve to make the command-line monolith a lot more user-friendly, and open up the computing market to more than just businesses and enthusiasts. Enter Microsoft Windows, a revolutionary tool for making computing on MS-DOS easier, and more intuitive, than ever before. Gone are the days of having to manually type and start an application at `C:\DOOM\DOOM.EXE`, it was now as easy as just point and click through a folder view in a window. Yes, there were already systems with GUIs at the time, but none with anywhere near the level of hardware support, software support, and flexibility as Microsoft Windows. Microsoft were on top of the world, and that's when they started taking a turn for the worse.

Microsoft had accumulated quite a bit of power, and influence, around this time. They practically owned the non-Apple PC world, so nothing was really in their way if they wanted to do something like [push other browsers out of existence by prepackaging their own browser](https://money.cnn.com/2002/01/22/technology/netscape/), which eventually led to [Internet Explorer 6 dominating the browser scene, and holding the entire Internet back](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_Explorer_6#Criticism), or try to [take Java and spin it into simply "A new cool way to make software on Windows"](https://caselaw.findlaw.com/us-9th-circuit/1260682.html), or incorporating an intentionally broken OpenGL driver into Windows Vista to make Direct3D look like the better option, which [ultimately led to Valve's distaste for Windows](https://www.extremetech.com/gaming/133824-valve-opengl-is-faster-than-directx-even-on-windows) It was around this time that Microsoft became the giant we know and hate, later buying out companies such as Mojang, Mixer, and GitHub (Yes, [I'm using a Microsoft platform to criticize Microsoft, fuck you](https://news.microsoft.com/announcement/microsoft-acquires-github/)).

## Why Microsoft still reigns supreme
Despite all the bullshit, [the performance drawbacks](https://interworks.com/blog/2021/02/11/put-to-the-test-is-windows-or-linux-faster/), the [completely disgusting data collection practices](https://privacy.microsoft.com/en-us/privacystatement) and even Microsoft's unending battle to get you to use Edge, we still use Windows... Why?

There are a few answers, of which I believe three are most important.

### Compatibility
Because Windows already was dominant before all of this, existing software already runs on it, existing drivers simply work for it, and software and drivers are still made for it as a result. As such, people are reluctant to move to a platform like Linux, where not everything may work. Even with Wine and Proton, and the progress they've made, still not everything is simply working, and not all devices work. Because nobody makes the switch, no other platform has the market share to justify the development costs for drivers, games, or other software for Linux, FreeBSD, or OpenBSD. In short, We're caught in a vicious cycle of "Linux won't get more support until it has more users, yet won't get more users until it gets more support".

### Usability
I am not in any way implying that Linux, macOS, or FreeBSD are less usable than Windows. In fact I regularly show quite the opposite. But the fact remains that Windows is simply *different* from the rest. There are concepts such as package management, software dependencies, and ~~actual customization features~~ that are simply foreign to Windows users. It's kind of like relearning to use your computer, and many people aren't willing to try something new and different.

(People like Mental Outlaw will say that Microsoft have institutionalized Windows users into not doing fucking C compile no config bullshit and blah, they're completely delusional, ignore them.)

### Deployment
This one's a pretty simple and obvious fact, Windows computers are everywhere. Best Buy, Target, Amazon, even GameStop somehow... Nearly every x86_64 consumer device on the market has Windows preinstalled. Linux lacks this deployment, as does FreeBSD and OpenBSD.

## Conclusion
While Windows is completely disgusting, and I would recommend avoiding it if possible, it's not possible, or feasible, for many people. A lot of people depend on the support Windows has going for it, be it for games, productivity software like the Adobe suite, or work reasons. As such **Ember will be supporting Windows, despite my will to yeet that piece of shit OS like a boss.** There are simply too many people who are dependent on Windows, and we can't abandon them, no matter how much I myself passionately hate Microsoft Windows.
